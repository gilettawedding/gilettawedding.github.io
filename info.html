			<h3>When should I get there?</h3>
			<p>Festivities will begin on Friday night (June 6th) with a barbecue welcome dinner, a movie showing, and various games and activities. Unfortunately, we are too broke to cover this for everyone, so dinner will cost $18 per person, and there will be a cash bar. The venue will open at 6pm, and dinner will run from 6:30-9:30pm to accommodate various arrival times. Other activities will run later into the evening as needed. We know travel timing can be difficult, and we don’t want anyone to go hungry, so please contact us if you have any concerns about the meal time.</p></br>

			<a id="when"></a></br>
			<h3>When will the ceremony happen?</h3>
			<p>The ceremony will occur in the late afternoon on Saturday, June 7th beginning at 4pm. The ceremony will last for about 90 minutes.</p></br>

			<a id="depart"></a></br>
			<h3>When should I plan to depart?</h3>
			<p>The reception and after-party will last until the wee hours of the morning, so plan to stay as late as you want that evening. We hope that folks staying over Saturday night will join us for Sunday brunch and send-off performances. Everyone should plan to leave by 12:30pm on Sunday.</p></br>

			<a id="dress-code"></a></br>
			<h3>What should I wear?</h3>
			<p>You can wear whatever you want (remembering that this is a family event). We like getting dressed up, so we're going to dress up, but that doesn't mean you have to. You can wear footie pajamas, if that’s your jam. Do keep in mind that, weather permitting, the ceremony will be outside. Afternoon temperatures in Hopewell Junction in early June average in the high sixties to low seventies, so make sure to dress appropriately for the weather. You may also want to consider bringing a pair of shoes in which you can walk comfortably on grass (and then dance all night).</p></br>

			<a id="kids"></a></br>
			<h3>Are kids welcome?</h3>
			<p>Yes! We love kids, and the venue is great for children because it is a summer camp! There will be activities for children during the day and we can arrange for childcare during the ceremony. All we ask is that you let us know as soon as you can that you plan to bring your little one(s) so that we can make arrangements accordingly. The party will go well into the night, and there will be an open bar, but there are plenty of motel rooms far away from the cacophony.</p></br>

			<a id="plus-1"></a></br>
			<h3>Can I bring a date?</h3>
			<p><strong>The short answer:</strong> Invitations do not include a plus one.</p>
			<p><strong>The long answer:</strong> We love you and we're sure we would love your date. However, we also want our wedding to be intimate enough that we know all the faces there. That said, some of you have new spouses or long-term significant others whom we've never met and really want to. We've tried to account for that by including those people’s names directly on the invitations, but if you have a special someone who wasn't named explicitly on your invite, please give us a call and we can figure things out together.</p></br>

			<a id="registry-info"></a></br>
			<h3>Do you have a wedding registry?</h3>
			<p><a href="/registry">You betcha!</a>
			</p></br>

			<a id="volunteer-info"></a></br>
			<h3>How can I help?</h3>
			<p>We’re super-excited about guest participation, so we would love your help with our various wedding-related projects! If you want to lend a hand, please shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:GilettaWedding2014@gmail.com">GilettaWedding2014@gmail.com</a> and we’ll invite you to the google doc that we’re using to coordinate volunteer efforts! We also know that you have far more talents than our simple task list calls for, and we would love for you to share them! Musicians, bring your instrument(s)! Dancers, bring your dancin’ shoes! Painters, bring your paints! Fire performers, bring your props! (We’ll have white gas and fire blankets available.) Whatever your medium, we hope you’ll consider sharing, and we’re happy to make arrangements as needed.</p>
