			<h1>Our Wedding Registry</h1></br>
			<p id="registry-blurb">Our Registry is divided into two parts.  Because we have already lived together for almost three years (and lived separately as adults before that), we already have a lot of the traditional wedding gift stuff. We therefore decided to focus our primary registry on experiences rather than material possessions, and then built a secondary registry for more traditional gifts.</p></br>

				<p id="to-do">Our <a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/gilettawedding2014">“Things to Do” registry on Zola</a> includes a honeymoon registry and some fun date ideas. The more expensive options have “group gifting” enabled, which allows you to contribute as much or as little as you would like to the cost of the experience. Group gifting items are identified by a group icon (three people on a little blue flag in the upper left hand corner).</p>

				<p id="to-have">For those of you who prefer to give a more tangible gift, we also have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/28JOZ27QR8UHP">"Things to Have" registry through Amazon</a>. Please note that we've tried to cover a variety of gift ideas, from things we need to things that would be fun to have, as indicated by the priority ranking. Remember, we have lots of things already, so please don't feel like this list needs to be completely checked off!</div>
