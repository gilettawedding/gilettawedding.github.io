			<h1>Our Wedding Registry</h1></br></br>
			<p>Our Registry is divided into two parts.  Because we have already lived together for almost three years (and lived separately as adults before that), we already have a lot of the traditional wedding gift stuff. We therefore decided to focus our registry on experiences rather than material possessions.</p></br>

			<p id="to-do">Our <a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/gilettawedding2014">“Things to Do” registry on Zola</a> includes a honeymoon registry and some fun date ideas. The more expensive options have “group gifting” enabled, which allows you to contribute as much or as little as you would like to the cost of the experience. Group gifting items are identified by a group icon (three people on a little blue flag in the upper left hand corner). Full disclosure: Zola does charge us a 2.5% processing fee on all gifts received through them, so we are happy to receive contributions directly and feel free to earmark such gifts for a specific experience.</p></br></br></br>

			<p id="to-have">For those of you who prefer to give a more tangible gift, we also have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/28JOZ27QR8UHP">traditional registry through Amazon.com</a>. Please note that we've tried to cover a variety of gift ideas, from things we need to things would be fun to have, as indicated by the priority ranking.</p>
