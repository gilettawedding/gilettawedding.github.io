			<p>The way we see it, our wedding is a rare opportunity to bring together the people we love most. It seems a shame to do all that work for just a few hours of fun, so we extended the festivities throughout a whole weekend in Hopewell Junction, NY, and we are throwing a second celebration in Atlanta for the many people who have touched our lives but could not make it to New York.</p></br>
			<p>Thanks to the love, support, and elbow grease of so many friends and family, our New York wedding celebration was a huge success. The event expressed who we are as individuals and as a couple. We are Quakers, so our ceremony followed the tradition of the Religious Society of Friends. We are big nerds, so we incorporated as many sci-fi, literature, and gaming references as we could muster. We are not particularly conventional, so we left out “to have and to hold” and other traditions that are "supposed to happen at a wedding" and brought in other traditions such as a Celtic handfasting. Ultimately, we love our families and the many other communities that we are a part of, so we tried to create a welcoming environment that fostered the interweaving of those many social circles, and our wonderful guests all dove head first into this vision.</p></br>
			<p>But the party is not over yet! We’re continuing the extravaganza with a second ceremony, reception, and after-party in Atlanta, GA. Our roots in Atlanta are strong and deep, so it’s very important for us to celebrate with the people who made us who we are. We are excited to experience another wedding adventure, and look forward to sharing it with everyone who can join us!</p>
