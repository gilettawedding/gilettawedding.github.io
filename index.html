			<h1>Our Vision</h1>
			<p>The way we see it, our wedding is a rare opportunity to bring the people we love most into a single place. It seems a shame to do all that work for just a few hours of fun, so we are extending the festivities throughout a whole weekend. We chose our venue with this vision in mind. <a href="http://www.campkr.com">Circle Lodge at Camp Kinder Ring</a> provides a whole host of activities for us to share in during our weekend "destination summer camp" wedding. We hope our guests will join us for as much of the weekend as they can manage.</p></br>
			<p>We also hope to create a wedding weekend that expresses who we are as individuals and as a couple. We are Quakers, so our ceremony will follow the tradition of the Religious Society of Friends. We are big nerds, so we are looking to throw in as many sci-fi, literature, and gaming references as we can muster. We are not particularly conventional, so we'll be leaving out “to have and to hold” and other traditions that are "supposed to happen at a wedding" and incorporating other traditions such as a Celtic handfasting. Ultimately, we love our families and the many other communities that we are a part of, so we want to create a welcoming environment that fosters the interweaving of those many social circles.</p>
