			<h1>The Venue</h1>
			<p>All events of the weekend will be held at <a href="http://www.campkr.com/">Circle Lodge at Camp Kinder Ring</a>, a sleepaway summer camp for kids and retirement retreat center for adults. It has a lake, many sports fields, heated pool (which will be open on Saturday!), a theater, and a huge lodge which is more than large enough to shelter all of our shenanigans. It is also a non-profit, which was a big draw for us.</p></br>
			<a id="directions"></a></br>
			<h3>How do I get there?</h3>
			<p><strong>By Metro North Railroad:</strong> Take the Harlem Line (the blue one) to the Pawling stop. A shuttle to and from the camp for a cost of $15 from this station (round trip) can be arranged as part of your RSVP and housing registration process.</p></br>

			<p><strong>By Air:</strong> There are two small airports very close to the site and several large airports in the New York City area. The closest is Stewart International Airport, which is the best option if you are planning to rent a car, as it is just a 30 minute drive to the summer camp from there. The second is Westchester (White Plains) Airport, which is a little farther but is linked to the Harlem Line of the Metro North Railroad (see above) so this is the best option for avoiding a car rental. The three New York City airports (Newark, John F. Kennedy, and LaGuardia) also link to the same rail line, but will take much longer; each is about a 90 minute drive from the camp.</p></br>

			<p><strong>By Car:</strong> Honestly, we don’t know, but our GPS does, and we bet yours does too! Here’s the address: 335 Sylvan Lake Rd, Hopewell Junction, New York, 12533. (In all seriousness, the camp is not far off of Interstate 84, and <a href="http://www.campkr.com/contact-us/visit-camp-kinder-ring">driving directions can be found here</a>.)</p></br>

			<h3>Where can I stay?</h3>

			<p>Our goal is for most of our guests to stay on-site so that we can all spend as much time as possible together. The two housing options on-site are:</br>
		(1) Motel rooms with a double bed and a single bed, private bathroom, A/C, heat, and standard hotel linens/toiletries.  These rooms will cost $130 per night (regardless of how many people are sharing the room).</br>
		or</br>
		(2) Hostel-style dorms with shared bathrooms and single beds.  A bed in these dorms will cost $50 per night without linens.  Linens can be provided for a one-time $5 fee.</br>
		All on-site reservations should be made through the RSVP and registration process. To RSVP, please follow the link provided in your invitation and complete the form as directed. All on-site housing prices include all meals and activities on Saturday and Sunday.</p></br>

			<p>Unfortunately, on-site housing is not limitless, so if the motel rooms get over-booked, we will have to give priority to out-of-town guests. You can help us out by considering the hostel-style housing, which is substantially cheaper than the motel rooms, or buddying-up and sharing a motel room with a friend.</p></br>

<p>If you decide you want a little personal space, there are hotels and campgrounds nearby. If you choose to stay off-site, you will have to pay extra for on-site meals other than the reception. You will also be responsible for transporting yourself to and from the venue.</p></br></br>
